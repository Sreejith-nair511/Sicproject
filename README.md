# Medical Diagnosis Prediction System

This is an enhanced medical diagnosis prediction system that uses machine learning to predict heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes risk based on patient data. The system combines powerful data analysis with an intuitive user interface to help medical professionals quickly assess patient risk profiles.

##  Key Features

###  Risk Profile Clustering
- Groups patients into different risk profiles using unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering)
- Helps identify patterns and similarities between patients
- Visualizes where a patient fits within the broader population

###  Multi-Disease Prediction
- Simultaneously predicts three major health conditions:
  - Heart Disease
  - Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)
  - Diabetes Risk
- Uses advanced Random Forest algorithms for accurate predictions

###  Interactive Dashboard
- Provides comprehensive visualizations of patient data and predictions
- Shows 6 different charts for complete insight into patient health
- Easy-to-understand graphs and metrics for medical professionals

###  Patient History Tracking
- Automatically saves all prediction results for future reference
- Maintains a detailed history in `patient_history.json`
- Helps track patient progress over time

###  Multiple Interface Options
- **Command Line Interface**: For technical users who prefer keyboard input
- **Graphical User Interface**: Easy-to-use form-based interface for all users
- **Web Application (Flask)**: Browser-based interface for remote access
- **Streamlit Application**: Modern web interface with interactive dashboards
- Choose your preferred method when starting the application

###  Self-Contained System
- Automatically generates sample data if no dataset is provided
- Works out-of-the-box with minimal setup
- No external dependencies required to get started

##  Enhanced Features

- **Patient History Tracking**: All predictions are automatically saved to `patient_history.json`
- **Enhanced Visualization Dashboard**: Comprehensive charts and graphs for better insights
- **Multiple Interface Options**: CLI, GUI, Flask Web, and Streamlit interfaces available
- **Automatic Data Generation**: Creates sample dataset if none exists
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery mechanisms
- **Deployment Scripts**: Simplified installation and execution process

##  Deploying as a Website

To deploy your medical diagnosis system as a public website:

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have all the required files:
   - `app.py` (main web application)
   - `Procfile` (for Heroku deployment)
   - `runtime.txt` (Python version specification)
   - `requirements.txt` (dependencies)
   - `templates/` directory with HTML files

### Deployment Options

#### Heroku (Recommended for beginners)
1. Install the Heroku CLI from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
2. Create a Heroku account
3. Login to Heroku: `heroku login`
4. Create a new app: `heroku create your-app-name`
5. Deploy: `git push heroku main`
6. Open your app: `heroku open`

#### PythonAnywhere
1. Sign up at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
2. Upload your files
3. Create a new web app and configure it to run your Flask application

#### Other Platforms
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure
- DigitalOcean

### Environment Variables
For production deployment, set these environment variables:
- `SECRET_KEY`: A random secret key for Flask security
- `PORT`: Port number (defaults to 5000)
